# Layout

To date, all pages in the Back Office application are using one of the three layout styles: **Layout \#1**, **Layout \#2** and **Layout \#3**.

**Note: **All CSS shown is for guiding purposes, it's not absolute.

#### Spacing guidelines

* The width of the content wrapper is set to auto and it depends on the browser's width. 
* Main content section has a padding on all sides, top and bottom of 24px and left and right of 32px.
