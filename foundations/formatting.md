# Formatting

On this page we can get instructions on how specific things are formatted. As an international company, localization, respecting different formats, and time zones are all important.

### Numbers

* Numbers should always have at least two decimals .
* Numbers over 3 digits get commas.
* Always prefix a currency amount with the code for the currency \(with a space\).
* Avoid using abbreviations for, or rounding up/down long numbers \(e.g. 10K\).

| Do | Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1.00 | 1 |
| 10.00 | 10 |
| 100.00 | 100 |
| 1,000.00 | 1000 |
|  |  |
| USD 1.00 | USD1.00 |
| USD 10.00 | $10.00 |
| USD 100.00 | 100.00 dollars |
| USD 100,000.00 | $100K |

### Writing

* [Sentence case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Sentence_case) should be used wherever possible, as it's easier to read and friendlier. This applies to all copy, including , paragraph copy, captions and form labels & inputs.
* Sentences, paragraphs and bullet pointed lists should always end with a period.
* Headers and sub-headers should never end with a period.
* Form labels should never end with a period.
* Avoid using ampersands wherever possible.

| Do | Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| A sentence like this. | A Sentence Like This. |
| A sentence like this and this. | A sentence like this & this. |
|  |  |
| A Header \#1 Like This | A header \#1 like this |
| A Header \#1 Like This and This | A Header \#1 Like This & This |
|  |  |
| A header \#2/3/4 like this | A Header \#2/3/4 Like This |
| A header \#2/3/4 like this and this | A header \#2/3/4 like this & this |

### Date

##### Written format

* Day of the week can \(if needed\) be shortened to 3 characters \(e.g. Friday becomes Fri\).
* If day of the week is included, it should be first in the order, followed by a comma.
* Month can \(if needed\) be shortened to 3 characters \(e.g. November becomes Nov\).
* A month should always be accompanied by a year, for clarity.
* A year should never be abbreviated. Use the full 4 digits.
* The day of the month should be a singular number, don’t include “st”, “nd” or “th”.
* The day of the month should always be accompanied by a month. The month followed by the number, and separated by a space. The year should now be separated by a comma and a space, to differentiate from the day number before it.
* Dates for today and tomorrow can be expressed as “today” or “tomorrow”. Dates further in the future, or in the past should be expressed more explicitly.

| Do | Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| Nov 2018 | Nov |
| November 2018 | November |
|  |  |
| Nov 2, 2018 | 2 Nov, 2018 |

##### Time range
