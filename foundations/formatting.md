* If day of the week is included, it should be first in the order, followed by a comma.
* A month should always be accompanied by a year, for clarity.
* A year should never be abbreviated. Use the full 4 digits.
* The day of the month should be a singular number, don’t include “st”, “nd” or “th”.
* The day of the month should always be accompanied by a month. The month followed by the number, and separated by a space. The year should now be separated by a comma and a space, to differentiate from the day number before it.
* Any times, shown inline with a date should separated from the date with a space.
