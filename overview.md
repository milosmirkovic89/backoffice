# Overview

The process of building the design system for Back Office application is based on **Atomic Design** methodology which is composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. The five stages of Atomic Design are: **Atoms**, **Molecules**, **Organisms**, **Templates **and **Pages**.

Atomic design is a design process created by [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and it is inspired by chemistry. In the natural world, atomic elements combine together to form molecules. These molecules can combine further to form relatively complex organisms.

To expound a bit further:

* Atoms are the basic building blocks of all matter. Each chemical element has distinct properties, and they canâ€™t be broken down further without losing their meaning.
* Molecules are groups of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. These combinations of atoms take on their own unique properties, and become more tangible and operational than atoms.
* Organisms are assemblies of molecules functioning together as a unit. These relatively complex structures can range from single-celled organisms all the way up to incredibly sophisticated organisms like human beings.

Atomic design is not a linear process, but rather a mental model to help us think of our user interfaces as both a cohesive whole and a collection of parts at the same time. Each of the five stages plays a key role in the hierarchy of interface design systems.
