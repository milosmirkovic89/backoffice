# Tab navigations

When there are multiple sub-pages on the screen tab navigations come into play. There are two kinds of them: **primary** and **secondary**.

**Note: **All CSS shown is for guiding purposes and it's not absolute.

### Primary

The primary tab navigation contains the pages that are built-in the system, for example the 'Customer Information' page for a specific user \(Details, Account information, Compliance, History...\).

#### General guidelines {#spacing-guidelines}

* Only first letter of the tab label should be capitalized.
* When number of tab items exceed the width of the content wrapper use [Nav arrows](/atoms/nav-arrows.md).

#### Spacing guidelines {#spacing-guidelines}

* The height of the Primary TN is 72px.
* There are paddings on the left and right of 16px.
