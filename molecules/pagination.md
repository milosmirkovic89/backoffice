# Pagination

Pagination is displayed below tables when there are a significant number of table rows.

**Note: **All CSS shown is for guiding purposes, it's not absolute.

#### General guidelines

* Pagination is centrally aligned.
* If the user is on the first page of table results, the ‘Back’ button is disabled. If they are on the last page of table results, ‘Next’ is disabled.
* If ≤ 6 pages, no need for truncating the pagination \(adding "..."\).
* An ellipses \(...\) is shown between non-consecutive pages
* The first and last page should always be visible.
* The previous two and the next two pages should always be visible.
* To sum up, the limit of the visible pages should be 7 \(first, last, selected, two before and two after selected one\).
