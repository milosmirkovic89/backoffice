# Date picker

Date pickers are mostly used in forms as data inputs or in header sections as data result filters. The data picker has two elements: **input base** and **calendar dialog**. The input base has up to 7 states, including: default, on-hover, on-focus, filled-out, disabled, hint and error.

**Note: **All CSS shown is for guiding purposes, it's not absolute.
