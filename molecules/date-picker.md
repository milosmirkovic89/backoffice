# Date picker

Date pickers are mostly used in forms as data inputs or in header sections as data result filters. The input of the data picker use almost the same CSS as [Dropdowns](//atoms/dropdowns.html) just instead of a caret arrow it uses a calendar icon and it has up to 7 states, including: default, on-hover, on-focus, filled-out, disabled, hint and error.

**Note: **All CSS shown is for guiding purposes, it's not absolute.
