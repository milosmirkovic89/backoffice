# The process

The process of building the design system for Back Office application is base on **Atomic Design** methodology which is composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. The five stages of Atomic Design are:

1. Atoms
2. Molecules
3. Organisms
4. Templates
5. Pages

Atomic design is not a linear process, but rather a mental model to help us think of our user interfaces as both a cohesive whole and a collection of parts at the same time. Each of the five stages plays a key role in the hierarchy of interface design systems.
