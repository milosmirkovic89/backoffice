# Templates

**Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages.**

At the template stage, we break our chemistry analogy to get into language that makes more sense to our clients and our final output. Itâ€™s here where we start to see the design coming together and start seeing things like layout in action.

Templates are very concrete and provide context to all these relatively abstract molecules and organisms.
