# Buttons

There are 4 types of buttons: **Primary**, **Neutral**, **Positive** and **Negative**. Each button style has 5 states, including: default, on-hover, pressed, loading and disabled. All button types come in two different height sizes of 40px and 32px, except Primary button which has additional 48px height size.

**Note:** All CSS shown is for guiding purposes and it's not absolute.

#### General guidelines

* Montserrat typeface should be always used for the text on buttons.
* There should be no icons on any type of the buttons.
* There is a subtle fade transition from normal to hover state on buttons \(_transition: all 0.2s;_\).
* Loading animation \(spinner icon\) on buttons found [here](#).

#### Spacing guidelines

* Depending on the height size, buttons have left and right padding of 12px, 16px, or 24px.
* Buttons contained in narrow spaces \(e.g. quote screen\) should fill 100% of the width available to them. This helps with cleaner alignment with other elements in that column, and also aligns multiple buttons when stacked.
* If multiple buttons are horizontally aligned, there should be a 16px margin separating them.

### Primary buttons

Primary buttons come in 3 different height sizes: **48px**, **40px** and **32px**. Each of them has 5 states noted above.

* Action oriented button. Think: ''Save', 'Next', 'Submit'.
* Normally the primary positive action in any scenario.
* Some scenarios are more suited to the **Positive** button style as the primary positive action, when the action doesn't need to be so prominent / stand-out.
* Ideally there should only be one Primary button on any screen/scenario \(the core action to proceed/progress/take action on the page\). If there isnâ€™t any one clear primary action, then consider using one or a combination of the other button styles.
