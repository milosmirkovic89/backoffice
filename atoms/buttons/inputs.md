# Input types

All input fields have the same height but they differ in a width size which separate them in 5 group sizes: **XL**, **L**, **M**, **S** and **XS**. Input fields are mostly used in forms so the group sizes are designed to fit them perfectly. Each input has up to 7 states, including: default, on-hover, on-focus, filled-out, disabled, hint and error.

**Note:** All CSS shown is for guiding purposes, it's not absolute.
