# Checkboxes

Checkboxes are mostly used in forms and tables in two ways: **Single-select** \(without a label\) in cases where they represent a switch on or off option; and **Multi-select** when there are multiple choices, and more than one option can be selected. Checkboxes have up to 6 states, including: default, on-hover, on-focus, disabled, hint and error. All checkboxes have width and height of 24px

**Note:** All CSS shown is for guiding purposes, it's not absolute.
