# Checkboxes

Checkboxes are mostly used in forms and tables in two ways: **Single-select** \(without a label\) in cases where they represent a switch on or off option; and **Multi-select** when there are multiple choices, and more than one option can be selected. Checkboxes have up to 6 states, including: default, on-hover, on-focus, disabled, hint and error. All checkboxes have width and height of 24px

**Note:** All CSS shown is for guiding purposes, it's not absolute.

#### General guidelines

* Consider using a [_Dropdown Multi-select_](//atoms/dropdowns.html#multi-select) if there are several \(6+\) choices; or in cases the form is long, or space is limited.
* Checkboxes are preferable over a[ _Dropdown Multi-select_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/milosmirkovic89/back-office/edit#) when itâ€™s important that the user sees the options available to them, to understand and consider, versus a more passive scan of their options via a multi-select.
