# Radio buttons

Radio buttons are mostly used when there are multiple choices, but only one option can be selected. They have up to 5 states, including: default, on-hover, on-focus, disabled and hint.

**Note: **All CSS shown is for guiding purposes, it's not absolute.

#### General guidelines {#general-guidelines}

* Radio buttons are ideal for simple either/or choices, or when there are only a couple/few choices.
* Consider using a [_Dropdown Multi-select_](//atoms/dropdowns.html#multi-select) if there are 6+ choices; or in cases the form is long, or space is limited.
* Radio buttons are preferable over a [_Dropdown Multi-select_](//atoms/dropdowns.html#multi-select) when itâ€™s important that the user sees the options available to them, to understand and consider, versus a more passive scan of their options via a select.
* A radio button can never be used singularly \(e.g. for a yes/no or opt-in/out data capture\), as it can only be selected, not un-selected. Therefore, a minimum of two options must be presented to use radio buttons. Use a [_Checkbox Single-select_](//atoms/checkboxes.html#single-select) if there is only one option.

#### Spacing guidelines

* The width and height of the radio buttons are always 20px.
* Radio buttons have a top and bottom margin of 10px and a right margin of 8px.
