# Tooltips {#tooltips}

Tooltips can be attached to any element. When you hover the element with your mouse, the title attribute is displayed in a little box next to the element, just like a native tooltip, only it can be styled as below. Tooltips are useful for things like form elements and tables, to show additional or helpful information.

**Note: **All CSS shown is for guiding purposes and it's not absolute.
