# Option tables

Option tables are a mix of the [Data tables](/organisms/data-tables.md) and [Forms](/organisms/forms.md). They are displayed in columns and rows, as Data tables, but they do not show data, they show options similar to those we have in Forms. The number of rows is limited and small so the footer with pagination or counter is not required.
