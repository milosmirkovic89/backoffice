Design systems enable teams to build better products faster by making design reusable—reusability makes scale possible. This is the heart and primary value of design systems.

##### Components

**A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.**

Components are portions of reusable code within your system and they serve as the building blocks of your application’s interface. Components range in complexity. Reducing components to a single function, like a button or a drop down increases flexibility, making them more reusable. More complex components, like tables for specific types of data, can serve their use cases well, but this complexity limits the number of applicable scenarios. The more reusable your components are, the less you need to maintain, and the easier scale becomes.
