# Molecules

**Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound. These molecules take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of our design systems.**

For example, a form label, input or button aren’t too useful by themselves, but combine them together as a form and now they can actually do something together.

In chemistry, molecules are groups of atoms bonded together that take on distinct new properties. For instance, water molecules and hydrogen peroxide molecules have their own unique properties and behave quite differently, even though they’re made up of the same atomic elements \(hydrogen and oxygen\). In interfaces, molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button can join together to create a search form molecule.

When combined, these abstract atoms suddenly have a purpose. The label atom now defines the input atom. Clicking the button atom now submits the form. The result is a simple, portable, reusable component that can be dropped in anywhere search functionality is needed. Now, assembling elements into simple functioning groups is something we’ve always done to construct user interfaces. But dedicating a stage in the atomic design methodology to these relatively simple components affords us a few key insights. Creating simple components helps UI designers and developers adhere to the single responsibility principle, an age-old computer science precept that encourages a “do one thing and do it well” mentality. Burdening a single pattern with too much complexity makes software unwieldy. Therefore, creating simple UI molecules makes testing easier, encourages reusability, and promotes consistency throughout the interface.
